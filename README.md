The Gaming Room, our client, required a software solution to manage and support their game, "Draw It or Lose It," a turn-based multiplayer game. The software needed to handle multiple game sessions while maintaining security, performance, and scalability. Throughout the development of the software design document, I excelled in clearly defining the system architecture and ensuring that key functional and non-functional requirements were met. One particularly helpful aspect of the design process was breaking down system components and detailing how they interact, which allowed for a structured approach to development. If I were to revise one part of my work, I would refine the user experience considerations by conducting more thorough user testing and incorporating feedback-driven improvements. Understanding user needs was a core element of the design, as it ensured the application was intuitive, responsive, and engaging, ultimately enhancing the overall gaming experience. To achieve this, I focused on usability principles and aligned the design with the clientâ€™s expectations. Moving forward, I would continue leveraging agile methodologies, user-centered design approaches, and modular architecture strategies to analyze and develop similar applications efficiently.
